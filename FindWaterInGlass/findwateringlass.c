/*
There are some glasses with equal capacity as 1 litre. The glasses are kept as follows:

    			   1
		         2   3
		      4    5    6
		    7    8    9   10

You can put water to only top glass. If you put more than 1 litre water to 1st glass, 
water overflows and fills equally in both 2nd and 3rd glasses. 
Glass 5 will get water from both 2nd glass and 3rd glass and so on.
If you have X litre of water and you put that water in top glass, 
how much water will be contained by jth glass in ith row?

Example. If you will put 2 litre on top.
1st C 1 litre
2nd C 1/2 litre
3rd C 1/2 litre
